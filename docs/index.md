# 🏔️ Welcome to the MCP Security Summit Workshop

## A Sherpa's Guide to Securing Model Context Protocol Servers in Azure

![MCP Workshop](images/sherpa-mcp-workshop.png)

## About This Workshop

*The summit awaits, but the climb itself teaches you everything you need to know.*

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** opens exciting new routes for AI applications to connect with data sources and tools, but like any unexplored peak, the terrain requires preparation. Unsecured MCP servers expose dangerous attack surfaces: authentication bypasses, data leakage, and unauthorized access threaten systems that lack proper defenses.

This workshop is your guided expedition to securing MCP servers in Microsoft Azure. You'll experience real vulnerabilities firsthand (by exploiting intentionally insecure systems), then learn proven techniques to fortify your defenses using Azure's native security services. By the time you reach the summit, you'll have climbed from basic authentication to enterprise-grade defense-in-depth with working code you can deploy in production.

!!! tip "What Makes This Expedition Unique"

    :material-target: **Learn by Breaking Things** - Experience vulnerabilities firsthand by exploiting intentionally insecure servers before learning to fix them

    :material-shield-check: **Azure-Native Security** - Leverage Azure Entra ID, Key Vault, API Management, AI Foundry, and other platform services designed for production workloads

    :material-routes: **Defense-in-Depth Journey** - Ascend through progressive camps, each building on the last to create comprehensive security layers

    :material-book-open-variant: **OWASP-Aligned** - Every technique maps directly to the [OWASP MCP Azure Security Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/mcp-azure-security-guide/), giving you industry-standard knowledge

    :material-code-braces: **Real Production Code** - Walk away with working, tested implementations you can adapt for your own projects

Whether you're a developer building your first MCP server or a security professional hardening existing systems, this workshop provides practical, actionable knowledge through a proven **"vulnerable → exploit → fix → validate"** methodology.

## The Expedition Route

Your journey follows a proven camp-to-camp progression. Each stage builds on the last, from reconnaissance at Base Camp to the final Red Team challenge at The Summit.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this expedition, you'll have climbed from vulnerable prototype to production-ready MCP architecture:

**:material-check-circle: Production-Ready Authentication** - OAuth 2.1 with PKCE, Azure Entra ID integration, and passwordless Managed Identity

**:material-check-circle: Hardened Network Perimeter** - Private endpoints, API Management gateway, and zero-trust networking

**:material-check-circle: Content Security Controls** - Input validation, Azure AI Content Safety integration, and PII detection

**:material-check-circle: Operational Monitoring** - Centralized logging, custom dashboards, and automated alerting

**:material-check-circle: Compliance Documentation** - OWASP risk mappings and audit trails for security reviews

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting your expedition, ensure you have:

:material-check: Azure subscription with Contributor access  
:material-check: VS Code with GitHub Copilot or MCP extension  
:material-check: Azure CLI installed and authenticated  
:material-check: Python 3.10+ installed  
:material-check: Basic familiarity with Azure Portal

!!! info "Detailed Setup Instructions"
    See the **[Prerequisites page](prerequisites.md)** for complete installation instructions, troubleshooting tips, and system requirements.

!!! tip "No Security Expertise Required"
    This workshop is designed for developers of all skill levels. If you can write Python code and navigate the Azure Portal, you're ready to climb!

!!! info "Workshop Format"
    **Hands-on labs** with live exploitation and remediation exercises  
    **Each camp** includes: vulnerable code → exploit → secure implementation → validation  
    **Self-paced** with optional instructor-led checkpoints

---

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your expedition? Follow these three simple steps:

=== "Step 1: Clone the Repository"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/sherpa.git
    cd sherpa
    ```
    
    !!! tip "Repository Structure"
        The repository contains the code you'll deploy and test. **Use the documentation site (this guide) to walk through the workshop.** Each camp's documentation provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and testing the code from the repository.

=== "Step 2: Verify Prerequisites"

    ```bash
    # Install uv for fast dependency management
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    
    # Verify Python version
    python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
    
    # Verify Azure CLI is installed and authenticated
    az --version
    az account show
    ```

=== "Step 3: Begin at Base Camp"

    **Follow the workshop documentation, not the repository folders!**
    
    :material-arrow-right: **[Start Base Camp Documentation](camps/base-camp.md)**
    
    The Base Camp guide will walk you through when to use VS Code and the repository code for deployment and testing. Think of it this way:
    
    - **This documentation site** = Your workshop guide and instruction manual
    - **The repository** = The code you'll deploy and test as directed by the guide
